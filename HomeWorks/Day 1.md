### Mathematics and Modular Arithmetic

#### 1. Working with the following set of Integers $\mathbb{S}$ = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

- **What is:**
  - a 4 + 4
  - b 3 $\times$ 5
  - c What is the inverse of 3 ?

#### 2. Considering $\mathbb{S}$ = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and the operation '+'

- Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group?

#### 3. Modular Operation

- What is -13 $\equiv$ 5 ?

#### 4. Polynomials

- For the polynomial $x^3$ - $x^2$ + 4x - 12, find:
  - The positive root.
  - The degree of this polynomial.
